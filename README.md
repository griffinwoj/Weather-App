##Weather-App

#Description
This is a weather dashboard application that allows users to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city. The application also keeps track of the user's search history.

##Usage

Simply enter the name of a city into the search bar and select "Search" to begin using the app. The program will show the current weather conditions for that city, along with the date, the name of the city, and icons for the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The software will also show a 5-day forecast that contains the date, an icon for the current weather, as well as the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

A city is added to the search history when a user searches for it. To examine the present and upcoming weather for a city again, the user can click on it in the search history
